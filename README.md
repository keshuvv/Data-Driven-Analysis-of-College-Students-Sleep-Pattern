# Sleep Consistency and Lifestyle Factors Among College Students

This project was developed as part of the final coursework for COGS108: Data Science in Practice at UC San Diego.

## Overview

Our project investigates the relationship between sleep consistency and various lifestyle factors among U.S. college students. Using survey data collected from UC San Diego students, we aimed to identify which quantifiable behaviors—such as screen time, exercise frequency, caffeine intake, and stress levels—are most strongly associated with maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.

## Motivation

With rising concerns around student well-being and mental health, we sought to understand how everyday habits influence sleep stability—a key factor in cognitive performance, focus, and long-term health. Our project bridges behavioral science and data science to uncover insights that may inform healthier routines among students.
