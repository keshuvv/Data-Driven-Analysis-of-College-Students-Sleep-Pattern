    "Maintaining a healthy sleep schedule is essential for college students in the U.S, as it directly impacts their academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. However, research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that around 75% of college students report experiencing sleep disturbances or poor sleep quality, largely due to demanding schedules and the challenges of balancing coursework, social activities, and work commitments.<a name=\\\"cite_ref-1\\\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Lifestyle factors such as caffeine intake, dietary habits, screen time, alcohol and substance use, stress levels, and study habits all play a huge role in shaping sleep patterns. For instance, the CDC notes that inconsistent sleep patterns, common among college students, contribute to issues like “daytime sleepiness,” which can impair focus and academic success.<a name=\\\"cite_ref-1\\\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project seeks to understand which of these lifestyle habits most strongly affect sleep consistency and quality, focusing on students with demanding college schedules. To do so, we will examine measurable sleep factors like total sleep hours, consistency in average bedtime and wake time, and overall sleep quality. By analyzing these metrics, we aim to pinpoint lifestyle behaviors that correlate with healthier sleep patterns among college students in the U.S., hoping to provide practical insights into developing better sleep routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has highlighted key lifestyle and mental health factors that impact sleep consistency among U.S. college students. For instance, one study found that habits like caffeine use, substance use, and high stress are strongly associated with sleep issues, showing how these daily choices affect students’ ability to keep a regular sleep schedule.<a name=\\\"cite_ref-2\\\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Similarly, research on sleep hygiene—such as managing screen time before bed, limiting caffeine intake, and moderation of alcohol use—demonstrates how these habits impact sleep quality, often making it difficult for students to maintain a steady routine.<a name=\\\"cite_ref-3\\\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note3) Another recent study on college students' sleep trends highlights that irregular schedules and high-stress levels are key contributors to poor sleep quality, emphasizing the importance of exploring how lifestyle and mental health impact sleep patterns.<a name=\\\"cite_ref-3\\\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note3)\n",

    "We hypothesize that, among U.S. college students aged 18-25, factors such as consistent bedtime and wake time, average duration of sleep, lower caffeine intake, limited screen time, and reduced substance use will correlate strongly with maintaining a “healthy” sleep schedule. We predict these variables will have a significant positive impact on sleep quality due to their direct influence on sleep duration and overall sleep hygiene. "

    "The ideal dataset for our study would contain comprehensive data on college students aged 18-25 in the U.S., capturing sleep and lifestyle variables crucial for understanding patterns linked to sleep health. Specifically, we would require data on the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sleep factors**: duration, quality, average bedtime and waketime (weekday vs. weekend)\n",

    "These datasets would ideally have properly named columns, containing data from college students ages 18-25 since that is the demographic we would like to understand better, with at least 6,000 unique entries once cleaning is complete. The data should also be from recent years (post-2020), since data from pre-pandemic may not be as accurate as post-pandemic data.\n",

    "In our project, it’s possible that our datasets exclude/do not properly label students who have underlying health problems such as insomnia, mental health issues, and chronic illnesses. These populations could be underrepresented, or their sleep data entries may be treated as outliers and were removed from the datasets before they were published for our team to access. We are also unsure where exactly our data comes from since there is no identifying information on it, meaning our data may not actually be spread across the entire US. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, student sleep and life habits may have been formed before the student arrived at university. It is possible that a student, due to their socioeconomic status, held jobs during high school contributing to what might be considered an “unhealthy” sleep schedule if they were up late completing assignments after their job. This lower sleep duration might be considered “unhealthy” even if it is something that they have become accustomed to. Interpersonal relationships for each student also may not be considered. An example is international students who may be staying up late or waking up very early to speak to their family members that are overseas, or a student who may be in a long distance relationship may report lower sleep duration without being able to convey this information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our research question does not explicitly address how student habits might have changed post-pandemic (i.e. staying up later or sleeping in longer), how certain household/bedroom settings may affect sleep (sharing bed/room, having loud roommates, etc). It is also very possible that, when participants were filling out these surveys, they were not entirely truthful in their responses surrounding substance or alcohol use. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid invading the privacy of survey-takers and their health problems/history, the datasets we have chosen assign a number to each observation, where the number increases from 1 to the end of the dataset, so there is no identifying information on the datasets we are using. "
