    "Maintaining a healthy sleep schedule is essential for college students in the U.S, as it directly impacts their academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. However, research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that around 75% of college students report experiencing sleep disturbances or poor sleep quality, largely due to demanding schedules and the challenges of balancing coursework, social activities, and work commitments.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Lifestyle factors such as caffeine intake, dietary habits, screen time, alcohol and substance use, stress levels, and study habits all play a huge role in shaping sleep patterns. For instance, the CDC notes that inconsistent sleep patterns, common among college students, contribute to issues like “daytime sleepiness,” which can impair focus and academic success.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project seeks to understand which of these lifestyle habits most strongly affect sleep consistency and quality, focusing on students with demanding college schedules. To do so, we will examine measurable sleep factors like total sleep hours, consistency in average bedtime and wake time, and overall sleep quality. By analyzing these metrics, we aim to pinpoint lifestyle behaviors that correlate with healthier sleep patterns among college students in the U.S., hoping to provide practical insights into developing better sleep routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has highlighted key lifestyle and mental health factors that impact sleep consistency among U.S. college students. For instance, one study found that habits like caffeine use, substance use, and high stress are strongly associated with sleep issues, showing how these daily choices affect students’ ability to keep a regular sleep schedule.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Similarly, research on sleep hygiene—such as managing screen time before bed, limiting caffeine intake, and moderation of alcohol use—demonstrates how these habits impact sleep quality, often making it difficult for students to maintain a steady routine.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Another recent study on college students' sleep trends highlights that irregular schedules and high-stress levels are key contributors to poor sleep quality, emphasizing the importance of exploring how lifestyle and mental health impact sleep patterns.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",

    "We hypothesize that, among U.S. college students aged 18-25, factors such as consistent bedtime and wake time, average duration of sleep, lower caffeine intake, limited screen time, and reduced substance use will correlate strongly with maintaining a sleep schedule of 7-9 hours. We predict these variables will have a significant positive impact on sleep quality due to their direct influence on sleep duration and overall sleep hygiene. The positive impacts of a sleep schedule of 7-9 hours will contribute to positive mental health and stress levels and GPA of at least 3.5."

    "    - This dataset offers information on how various factors impact and individual’s mental health. Demographic information is taken such as age and gender. Variables such as daily screen time, self-reported mental health and sleep quality scores from scales of 1-10 are included. The dataset also includes other lifestyle details such as gaming, physical activity, support system access, and work environment effects. There are 10,000 unique observations, though we anticipate that this number will decrease greatly since the age range is from 18-65, and our focus is individuals aged 18-25.\n",

    "In our project, there are potential unintended consequences that could arise from our analysis. By focusing on specific measurable factors, we may inadvertently oversimplify the complexity of sleep behaviors among students. For instance, our findings could reinforce stereotypes or generalizations about students with irregular sleep schedules without fully considering underlying causes like socioeconomic pressures, mental health challenges, or cultural factors. Such oversights might lead to conclusions that are not inclusive or effective for all students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our datasets may exclude or mislabel students who have underlying health conditions such as insomnia, mental health issues, or chronic illnesses. These populations might be underrepresented, and their data could be disproportionately treated as outliers and removed before the datasets were made accessible to us. Additionally, we acknowledge that the anonymized nature of our datasets limits our ability to confirm that the data truly represents college students across the US, which could introduce regional or demographic biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Socioeconomic factors present another challenge. For example, students from lower-income backgrounds may have formed sleep habits during high school while managing jobs or other responsibilities, contributing to what might be labeled as \"unhealthy\" sleep schedules. Our project does not directly measure these socioeconomic factors, and we acknowledge that this could limit the depth of our analysis. Similarly, interpersonal relationships and cultural practices, such as international students managing time zone differences to stay connected with family, could also influence sleep patterns in ways not captured in our surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we do not explicitly address how habits may have changed post-pandemic (e.g., altered sleep patterns due to remote learning or shifting routines) or the impact of environmental factors such as shared living spaces, loud roommates, or limited access to comfortable sleeping arrangements. These factors could significantly influence sleep quality but are not accounted for in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate privacy concerns, our datasets anonymize participants by assigning numbers to each observation. While this ensures no personal or identifying information is used, it also limits our ability to contextualize the data fully. Participants' self-reported survey responses may also contain inaccuracies due to social desirability bias or hesitancy to disclose substance or alcohol use, potentially skewing our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these biases and unintended consequences, we will:\n",
    "1. Acknowledge the limitations of our data and analysis, particularly the absence of socioeconomic and environmental context.    \n",
    "2. Avoid broad generalizations, presenting findings as trends specific to the datasets.\n",
    "3. Recommend future research to explore underrepresented populations and additional variables like socioeconomic status, mental health, and environmental factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By critically reflecting on these aspects, we aim to ensure our study is ethical, inclusive, and aware of its limitations."
